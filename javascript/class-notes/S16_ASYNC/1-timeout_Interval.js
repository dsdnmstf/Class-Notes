//! Javascript is a single-threaded and Asynchronous programming language.

//? Asynchronous programming
//? -----------------------------------------------------------------------
//? Asynchronous programming is a form of parallel programming that allows
//? a unit of work to run separately from the primary application thread.
//? When the work is complete, it notifies the main thread (whether the
//? work was completed or failed). There are numerous benefits to using it,
//? such as improved application performance and enhanced responsiveness.

//? Especilly time expensive processes like getting data from an API or Database,
//? Input/Output process, File Reading or Writing should be programmed with Asyn
//? Programming technique.
